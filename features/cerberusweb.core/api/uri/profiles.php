/*
 * IMPORTANT LICENSING NOTE from your friends on the Cerberus Helpdesk Team
 * 
 * Sure, it would be so easy to just cheat and edit this file to use the 
 * software without paying for it.  But we trust you anyway.  In fact, we're 
 * writing this software for you! 
 * 
 * Quality software backed by a dedicated team takes money to develop.  We 
 * don't want to be out of the office bagging groceries when you call up 
 * needing a helping hand.  We'd rather spend our free time coding your 
 * feature requests than mowing the neighbors' lawns for rent money. 
 * 
 * We've never believed in hiding our source code out of paranoia over not 
 * getting paid.  We want you to have the full source code and be able to 
 * make the tweaks your organization requires to get more done -- despite 
 * having less of everything than you might need (time, people, money, 
 * energy).  We shouldn't be your bottleneck.
 * 
 * We've been building our expertise with this project since January 2002.  We 
 * promise spending a couple bucks [Euro, Yuan, Rupees, Galactic Credits] to 
 * let us take over your shared e-mail headache is a worthwhile investment.  
 * It will give you a sense of control over your inbox that you probably 
 * haven't had since spammers found you in a game of 'E-mail Battleship'. 
 * Miss. Miss. You sunk my inbox!
 * 
 * A legitimate license entitles you to support from the developers,  
 * and the warm fuzzy feeling of feeding a couple of obsessed developers 
 * who want to help you get more done.
 *
 * - Jeff Standen, Darren Sugita, Dan Hildebrandt, Scott Luther,
 * 		and Jerry Kanoholani.
