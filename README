Under Class CerberusApplication
Function translateTeamCategoryCode

I made the following changes.

/**
* Translates the string version of a group/bucket combo into their
* respective IDs.
*
* @todo This needs a better name and home
*/
static function translateTeamCategoryCode($code) {
$t_or_c = substr($code,0,1);
$t_or_c_id = intval(substr($code,1));

if($t_or_c=='c') {
$categories = DAO_Bucket::getAll();
$team_id = $categories[$t_or_c_id]->team_id;
$category_id = $t_or_c_id;
} else {
$team_id = $t_or_c_id;
if($t_or_c=='a') {
$category_id = -1;
} else {
$category_id = 0;
}
}

return array($team_id, $category_id);
}

I did this so I could use this for reports were I need both inbox $category_id=0 and all I decided to use $category_id=-1 for.
