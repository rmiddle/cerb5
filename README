[Parser] There isn't enough error checking before the unlink() call to trap all failing mail

Most of it is outlined in this forum post.

The simple issues is that function _parseFile($full_filename) { doesn't check for error before calling @unlink($full_filename); so the file gets deleted no mater what and only moved to failed if you have code in place to trap a certain error. I see several errors that could result in the lose of emails. At a min that function needs updated with code to check for errors and move the to fail instead of removing it on fail.
