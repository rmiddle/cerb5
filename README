Add the abilty to filter based on inbox downloaded from.

Not that hard.  Only really requires a 1 line change.

 For what it's worth, the code we used is here:

** in 4.2 -- /var/www/html/cerb4/plugins/cerberusweb.core/api/cron.classes.php
on Line 1111

We inserted
fwrite($fp,"\r\nDownloaded-From: $account->nickname");

So, the section it's in now looks like this.
Lines 1110-1115:

if($fp) {
fwrite($fp,"Downloaded-From: $account->nickname\r\n");
fwrite($fp,$headers,strlen($headers));
fwrite($fp,"\r\n\r\n");
fwrite($fp,$body,strlen($body));
@fclose($fp);
}

Of course this should probably be turned into a regular header and handled with the rest of the list, but that's how it's working now.
